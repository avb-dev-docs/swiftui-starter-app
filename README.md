#  SwiftUI Starter App

> [!NOTE]  
> This is a SwiftUI Starter codebase that shows how to do a lot of the basics, and connect them all together. I'm by no means an expert, an enthusiast! I can't say I've adopted all the best practice, but I will work to maintain the codebase and ensure it runs! I hope it provides value for you! Feel free to create a PR or Issue if there is something you'd like to change or include! - Ryan (@mccaffers)
